\part{Management Summary}\label{part:mgmtsummary}
\chapter*{Initial situation}
Roadster is mindclue GmbH's in-house framework to build modern supervision and
control applications used in different fields such as traffic systems, energy,
and water supply. It is written in Ruby, a modern and expressive scripting
language, and is built on a shared-nothing architecture to avoid a whole class
of concurrency and scalability issues found in traditional application
architectures.

Although considered to be the next generation of its kind, it still lacks
important features such as the ability to be run on multiple
nodes in a federation, high availability, and secure network communications.

\chapter*{Goals}
Adding the aforementioned, missing features to form the next version of the
framework would mean a distinct advantage for mindclue GmbH and thus increase
its competitiveness in its sector.

Planning the exact architectural changes and additions, as well as performing
the implementation is the students' goal for this bachelor thesis. Using
engineering methodology acquired and practiced at HSR, solutions for particular problems
will be worked out and the best fitting ones will be chosen and integrated.

Although not exactly part of the requirements, spreading knowledge about Roadster's
architecture and code basis is also in the interest of the client, as Andy Rohr
is currently the framework's only maintainer and thus a single point of failure
in an increasingly important piece of software.

\chapter*{Results}
The exact requirements have been gathered. Feasibility has been proven using
prototype implementations. The prototypes have been concretized and integrated
into the Roadster codebase using software engineering methodology acquired and
practiced at HSR.

Deploying Roadster as a federation of nodes, including highly available nodes
and secure network communication is now possible and straight forward to do.
Comprehensive tests verify the correct functioning of the newly added features.
This document describes in great detail the exact engineering approach the
students have taken.
