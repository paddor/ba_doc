\chapter{Project monitoring}
Checklist items on GitHub issues are estimated to take up to 4 hours of effort to complete.

\autoref{fig:weekly:hours} illustrates the weekly time spent on this bachelor
thesis. The thick horizontal line represents the planned effort of 28.5 hours a
week, which has been calculated using the risk analysis explained
in~\autoref{sec:projplan:est-time}.  Milestones are denoted by the green
labels. The legend along the x-axis represents the semester weeks, including
the particular RUP phases.

As can be seen in the figure \autoref{fig:weekly:hours}, we have spent the
least amount of time per week at the beginning of this thesis. This is because
gathering requirements was delayed for a few days. Before the Elaboration
phase, we had all necessary information such as requirements gathered and were
ready to start with planning and the conceptual work.

The nominal hours required by the course description have exceeded by 10\%.
The federation prototype took longer than planned. After getting more familiar with Roadster, we were able to better estimate time efforts.
\autoref{fig:hours:per:feature} illustrates the estimated versus the actual effort.

The students have a balanced hours total, because efforts and tasks were
re-evaluated on GitHub and Everhour at regular intervals.

The exported Everhour data can be found in our final submission on Moodle. Everything can be derived from this data.

8\% of the whole project duration was used for project management and meetings. 2\% were used for requirement meetings with the client.
The distribution corresponds fully to the planned phases as shown in \autoref{fig:hours:per:tag}.
