\chapter{High Availability}\label{ch:ha}

TODO we have two different kinds of HA
TODO explain the kinds of failures we want to be able to handle

\section{Single Level HA}
\subsection{Concept}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customsh]
  - this is different from what's described in the zguide because the concept of client requests is missing here (PLCs don't request anything)
  - life sign from one node to the other through some continually updated PLC value
  - mark active HA peer in DIM, OR PUSH-PULL \& different route back
    - evaluate in elaboration
  - side note: PUSH-PULL is probably not feasible, because message are sent to inactive pull anyway, until queue full
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementation}
TODO explain how we implement/integrate it

%-----------------------------------

\section{Multi Level HA}
\subsection{Concept}
Finding consensus should be easier here, as it's closely related to the CHP described in the zguide.

\subsection{Implementation}
TODO explain how to implement/integrate Binary Star
