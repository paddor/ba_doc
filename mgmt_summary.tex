\part{Management Summary}\label{part:mgmtsummary}
\chapter*{Initial situation}
Roadster is mindclue GmbH's in-house framework to build modern supervision and
control applications in different fields such as traffic systems, energy,
and water supply. It is written in Ruby, a modern and expressive scripting
language, and is built on a shared-nothing architecture to avoid a whole class
of concurrency and scalability issues found in traditional application
architectures.

Although considered to be the next generation of its kind, it still lacks
important features such as the ability to be run on multiple
nodes in a federation, high availablity, and secure network communications.

\chapter*{Goals}
Adding the aforementioned, missing features to form the next version of the
framework would mean a distinct advantage for mindclue GmbH and thus increase
its competitiveness in its sector.

Planning the exact architectural changes and additions, as well as performing
the implementation is the students' goal for this bachelor thesis. Using
engineering methodology acquired and practiced at HSR, solutions for particular problems
will be worked out and the best fitting one will be chosen.

Although not exactly part of the requirements, spreading knowledge about Roadster's
architecure and code basis is also in the interest of the client, as Andy Rohr
is currently the framework's only developer and thus a single point of failure
in an increasingly important piece of software.
