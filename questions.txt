=====
* does Roadster require different ZMQ contexts in the same process?
  - not possible in CZTop, because it's based on CZMQ, which completely hides
    the concept of contexts
  - (maybe possible via deprecated API and considerable effort to introduce
    that in CZTop)
* legacy code raises RuntimeError for socket exceptions.
  - Is it bad to raise more specific ones? (done by CZTop)
* instead of :bind/:connect, CZMQ supports endpoint syntax
  - bind:    "@tcp://foo:555"
  - connect: ">tcp://foo:555"
* how efficient does it have to be?
  - right now, every time EM::ZMQ::Socket#send_msg is called, some object is created just to find out whether socket is writable
  - similar when receiving all queued messages in #recv_msg
* CLIENT/SERVER sockets?
  - now possible with ZMQ 4.2
  - replacement for REQ/REP/DEALER/ROUTER sockets
  - thread safe
  - simplified message routing
  - only single part messages
