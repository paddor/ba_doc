Documentation
-------------
* CERN paper on MOMs (img/cern_middleware.pdf)
* iterative design
* crash course in ZMQ
  - intelligent sockets with simple interface (create, bind/connect, send/recv)
  - abstraction of low-level stuff (connection handling, buffering, client addresses, heartbeating (ZMQ 4.2+), encryption, ...)
  - socket types
  - message envelopes
  - divide & conquer
  - multi threading made easy (don't share anything, communicate through messages) => CZMQ actor
  - the CZMQ layer
* a few words about ZMQ RFCs
  - ZMTP
  - ZMTP-CURVE/ZAP (encryption+authentication, inclusively NaCl/libsodium/Daniel J. Bernstein's algorithms)
* a few words about CZTop
  - thin Ruby binding for CZMQ
  - why it makes working with the lower level binding (czmq-ffi-gen) more Ruby-like
  - how it handles errors/interrupts (shit that's important and painful in C)
* explain Binary Star pattern
  - state diagram (FSM)
* explain Clone pattern
  - state diagram of client
* use this syntax for multi-part messages: [foo][bar][blob]
* define reliability
  - what failures do we want to handle
* burn down charts, gantt charts, ...

Project Management
------------------
* github project
  - pro: github is single source of truth, cards and issues
  - it has columns, milestones, drag&drop, ...
  - con: no gantt, only one repo per project
  - with Everhour for time tracking and reporting
  - HuBoard/Waffle.io/ZeHub/Zube ???
    - all the same, probably just older than github's own board software

* trello
  - pro: battle tested, many integrations
  - attach commit/issue/branch/PR from github
  - time tracking: Harvest (integrated into trello) or Punchtime (as webapp, browser ext, or mobile app)
  - gantt charts: Elegantt
  - con: no milestones :((((

General Plan
------------
* read and understand existing Roadster code
* add specs if needed
* port to CZTop
* figure out what exact functionality we need
  - either we need exactly what Zguide describes as Clustered Hashmap Protocol (CHP)
  - or our own protocol derived from that
    - "isn't only about serialization strategies, it's also about synchronous versus asynchronous, error handling and the cost of change."
  - we need to at least add security, which should be easy
  - maybe we can implement our protocol on top of CHP
  - describe test scenarios
* service discovery?
  - hard coded
  - static config files [chosen during requirements meeting]
  - config files synced over Etcd
  - Zookeeper
  - CZMQ's ZBeacon functionality
* ZeroMQ transport: TCP or maybe TIPC?
  - TIPC (Transparent Inter Process Communication) is made for clusters,
    Linux-only, L2/L3 protocol, location transparent (addresses identify services,
    not nodes), requires direct links (no routing), reliable message passing
    whether connection-oriented or connection-less
* create new ruby gem: ruby-zguide-patterns (or maybe back to "cztop-patterns"?)
  * implement Binary Star pattern as reusable reactor
  * implement Clone (CHP) pattern as reusable actor/reactor (client/server)
    - client supports talking to 1 or 2 Clone servers
  * one difference from zguide: use ZMTP 3.1 heartbeats instead of "HUGZ" commands
* integrate new gem into Roadster
  - run test scenarios, log and interpret results
  - also measure & document performance
* enable encryption
  - think of a way to distribute/store key files (if needed)
* ... whatever requierements are left


* I don't think we need:
  - reliable request-reply patterns (* Pirate patterns)
    - well yes, the first of them (Lazy Pirate) is the client side for BStar)
  - service-oriented broker (Majordomo pattern)
  - disconnected reliability (messages stored on disk) (Titanic pattern)
  - brokerless name resolution service (Freelance pattern)
    - use zconfig files instead?
