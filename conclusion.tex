% CZTop: software design proven, it worked like a charm



Getting to know Roadster and its software architecture was very exciting and insightful.
Working with modern technologies such as NaCl, GitLab, Docker, Mininet, CZTop was truly inspirational.

The collaboration effort between the students, the professor, and Andy Rohr
from mindclue GmbH was a huge enrichment.

We sincerely hope the contributions worked out in this bachelor thesis will add
tangible value to the client's business.
