Feature: Persistence synchronization
  In order to collection and allow aggregation of persisted data
  As a Roadster federation node
  I need to be able to inform my supernode about changes to persisted data

  Background:
    Given a federation of multiple levels

  Scenario: Initialization persistence synchronization
    # TODO
    Given the current node has a supernode

  Scenario: Continuous persistence synchronization
    # TODO
    # * up to 30 seconds!
    # * close to 100% consistency and 0 data loss
    # * towards root

	Scenario: Persistence synchronization after link failure recovery
    # TODO
		Given
		When
		Then
		And
