% Subtitle (for DAB tool):
% Increasing the safety and security of systems supervising industrial equipment in tunnels, traffic systems, and water supply systems.

% introduction
Roadster is mindclue GmbHâ€™s in-house framework to build modern supervision and
control applications found in various technical fields including traffic
systems, energy, and water supply. Event-driven in nature, it is written in Ruby
and uses \zmq to pass messages within a system of loosely coupled actor processes following a
shared-nothing architecture. State changes are replicated using messages. A
web UI and sophisticated alarm case management are part of a normal
Roadster application.

% goal
The following goals were pursued as part of this project. To increase the flexibility of Roadster installations, the framework
needed to be extended with the capabilities to run on multiple autonomous machines. Furthermore, to
provide a highly available service, pairs of identical machines needed to be able to
operate in a redundant setup. This ensures a continuous service delivery in case one of
the machines fails. The communication between such machines needed to be be secured through the use
of encryption. Interoperability with client systems interacting with
such a redundant setup also needed to be guaranteed.

% approach and technologies
% picture: technology cloud
The students gathered exact requirements, developed solutions fitting Roadster's
software architecture, including prototypes, new communication protocols and required components.
All contributions have been made following software engineering methodology and
applying best-practices.
Modern cryptography software is used to encrypt network
traffic as well as verify the authenticity of messages passed between machines.
	New and a significant amount of existing functionality
has been verified using comprehensive test suites ranging from unit tests to system
tests encompassing virtual networks of fully isolated Roadster machines.
Behavior-driven testing frameworks and technologies such as GitLab CI, Mininet, and Docker have been leveraged for
continuous integration and quality assurance.

% result
% picture: terminal screenshot of startup sequence
Groups of Roadster machines (including the aforementioned high availability
clusters) can now be configured using a domain-specific language.
State is replicated across machines through secure network communication.
Redundant machines operate in an active/passive setup while ensuring
interoperability with external client systems. Utilities to simplify
the bootstrapping process of new Roadster machine (key generation
and distribution) are provided and documented.
All steps taken to reach the final result are documented comprehensively.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Prof. Dr. F. Mehta for his competent guidance during
this bachelor thesis.  We highly value his opinions. Due to his polite
parlance, discussing project matters and seeking administrative advice
regarding this document has always been an enrichment.

We also thank Andy Rohr of the mindclue GmbH for his help and support in
finding our bearings within Roadster's codebase and his precious input in the
design process and decision making.

Special thanks to Pieter Hintjens {\textdagger} (3 December 1962 -- 4 October
2016) for his amazing work and contagious passion within the \zmq and
distributed computing communities. We send our deepest condolences to his
family. Rest in peace.

\chapter{Development infrastructure}
\section{Personal development machines}
P. Wenger's personal development machine for Roadster was an Ubuntu 16.04 VM
running in VirtualBox on macOS. Most of the work took place within a fullscreen terminal
emulator (iTerm2\footnote{\url{https://iterm2.com}}) connected to the VM via SSH. Tmux was used within that to
persist the open workspace (multiple running shells and panes) across
suspensions of the VM.

Tmux windows used:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item NeoVim\footnote{\url{https://neovim.io}} with tabs and windows for development of features and specs.
	\item Automatic execution of specs whenever a file (implementation or
		specs) changes. This is done using
		Guard.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/guard/guard}}
	\item Manually started Roadster instances (usually two in side-by-side Tmux panes).
\end{enumerate}

The VM was not used to write this document. Instead, an instance of NeoVim and
a PDF viewer was used directly on the host OS. The repository's Makefile helped
automating the build process.

M. Schuler used RubyMine\footnote{\url{https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby}} on Windows for development and an Ubuntu VM to run
Roadster and the new system tests. To do so, the source code directory being
modified by the IDE was mounted inside the VM.

\section{Tools and technologies}
The source code of this document and all of our code contributions are hosted
on GitHub. The students will plan and organize contributions directly on the
collaboration platform as far as possible. This means creating a Project board\footnote{\url{https://github.com/thewesch/ba-roadster-doc/projects?sort=oldest}} for each of the
development iterations, creating, assigning, and closing issues, as well as using
the Wiki feature to plan and document meetings with the professor and the
client. Time tracking is done externally on Everhour. For an overview of
particular development tools used, see \autoref{tab:dev:tools}.
The versions of languages and libraries used are listed in \autoref{tab:dev:libs}.
