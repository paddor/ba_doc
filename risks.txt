risk (likelihood): low, medium, high
severities: minor, medium, major, fatal


* Roadster requires different ZMQ contexts
  - risk: low
  - not possible with CZTop because CZMQ hides contexts
  - severity: medium
  - solution: extract and run affected ZMQ sockets in their own process

* wrong protocols chosen / protocol design flaw
  - risk: medium
  - severity: major (or even fatal)
  - prevention: architecture reviews, prototypes
  - solution: fix (reevaluate, reengineer, redesign)

* CHP/BSTar (if these are needed) difficult to implement as reusable code
  - severity: major
  - prevention: prototypes
  - nice solution:
    - build more iteratively, step by step
  - dirty solution:
    - customized solution built right into Roadster, not as a public gem

* CZTop design flaws/limitations
  - severity: low (because it's just a thin wrapper to CZMQ), or
              medium (because it's relatively young and not battle tested)
  - solution: adapt CZtop

* CZMQ changes API
  - risk: low
  - severity: medium
  - solution: adapt CZTop, maybe change CZTop adapter in Roadster

* wrong time estimations
  - risk: medium
  - severity: medium (depends on how much estimatiion is off)
  - solution: reserve time

* ASCII Gantt charts too painful to update
  - risk: medium
  - severity: minor
  - solution: split each RUP phase, then only plan ahead for one phase/sprint

* complete ASCII Gantt chart doesn't fit into one page in documentation
  - risk: high
  - severity: minor
  - solution: split, one partial Gantt chart per RUP phase (could improve readability as well)

* bad readability of ASCII Gantt chart
  - risk: medium
  - severity: minor
  - solution: add vertical lines and/or split up into partial Gantt charts

* finer grained resolution than quarter days (2 hours) needed in Gantt
  - risk: low
  - severity: minor
  - solution: think of better syntax, maybe ".:-=" for <1h, ~1h, ~2h, ~4h

* managing multiple Projects (at least one per repo) on Github too painful
  - risk: high
  - severity: minor
  - partial solution: CodeTree
    - can't be used for private repos like roadster itself
  - complete solution: using a single Project which just has cards that link
                       to issues from other repos
    - linking to "foreign" issues is additional effort
    - should be straight forward using Github syntax (org/repo#42 or maybe
      even repo#42 within same org)
