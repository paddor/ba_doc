+ = pro

Trello & Github:
+ kanban cards
+ multi repo support
+ Harvest time tracking (expensive)
+ labels to differentiate different kinds of work (documentation/concept/hacking)
+ Gantt charts through elegantt.io or gantiffy)
+ no Burndown charts
- no access to private repo (reported to Trello Support)
- no milestones (KILLER)



Github only:
+ milestones
+ labels to differentiate different kinds of work (documentation/concept/hacking)
+ kanban cards through Projects
- one Project per repo (not necessarily a bad thing)
+ free basic project management (the only thing to pay here is Everhour)
+ great Wiki syntax
+ tightly integrated with issues/source code/PRs/wiki
+ PRs with Code Review feature
+ Everhour time tracking (less expensive)
+ Code Frequency/Commit charts
+ "Pulse" which shows number of recently active/closed/created issues
- no Gantt (ganttify and elegantt.io only support Trello)
- no Burndown charts



Redmine:
+ time tracking & reporting
+ trackers to differentiate different kinds of issues (documentation/concept/hacking)
+ mile stones
+ closed source code is hosted securely if hosted on Andy's server, instead of HSR VM
+ Gantt charts (see below)
- useless Gantt implementation (enormous effort to keep it up-to-date)
- no kanban cards
- need to host github repo on same machine (instead of Github)
- bad wiki syntax (textile) (we could use github's wiki for meeting minutes anyway)
- no Burndown charts
- no PRs, no Code Review feature



DO WE REALLY NEED GANTT?? => ask Prof. Mehta
